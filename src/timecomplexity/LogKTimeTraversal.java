         * âœ… Time Complexity: O(logâ‚– n)
         * Where:
         *    n = size limit (e.g. 1000)
         *    k = multiplication factor (e.g. 3)
         *
         * ðŸ’¡ How?
         * Every time we multiply i by k, so:
         *    i = 1, k, k^2, k^3, ..., k^x
         * Stop when: k^x >= n
         * => x = logâ‚–(n)
         *
         * Example:
         *    n = 1000, k = 3
         *    k^0 = 1
         *    k^1 = 3
         *    k^2 = 9
         *    k^3 = 27
         *    k^4 = 81
         *    k^5 = 243
         *    k^6 = 729
         *    k^7 = 2187 (loop stops here)
         *
         * So total iterations â‰ˆ 7 steps â‡’ O(logâ‚ƒ n)
