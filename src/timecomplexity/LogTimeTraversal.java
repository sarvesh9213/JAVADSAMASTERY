         * âœ… Time Complexity: O(log n)
         *
         * ðŸ’¡ Why?
         * On each iteration, i is doubled:
         * Iteration 1: i = 1
         * Iteration 2: i = 2
         * Iteration 3: i = 4
         * Iteration 4: i = 8
         * Iteration 5: i = 16
         * Iteration 6: i = 32
         * Iteration 7: i = 64
         * Iteration 8: i = 128 (loop ends here since i â‰¥ n = 100)
         *
         * So the number of steps is roughly:
         * logâ‚‚(n)
         * For n = 100, logâ‚‚(100) â‰ˆ 6.64 â‡’ loop runs ~7 times
         *
         * Hence, Time Complexity: O(log n)
